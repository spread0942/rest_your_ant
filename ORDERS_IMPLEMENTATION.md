# Orders Management System - Implementation Summary

## Created Views

### 1. OrdersList.vue (`/var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant/frontend/src/views/OrdersList.vue`)
- **Purpose**: Main orders list view with filtering capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Displays all orders in a card grid layout
  - Filters by status (pending, preparing, ready, delivered, cancelled)
  - Filters by table
  - Filters by date
  - Shows order number, status, table info, total amount
  - Actions: View, Edit, Delete orders
- **Route**: `/orders`

### 2. OrderDetail.vue (`/var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant/frontend/src/views/OrderDetail.vue`)
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of a single order
- **Features**:
  - Shows complete order information
  - Lists all plates and drinks with quantities and prices
  - Shows order modifications (products added/removed from plates)
  - Status progression buttons (pending → preparing → ready → delivered)
  - Order summary with totals
- **Route**: `/orders/:id`

### 3. OrderCreate.vue (`/var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant/frontend/src/views/OrderCreate.vue`)
- **Purpose**: Create new orders or edit existing ones
- **Features**:
  - Basic order information (table, status, notes)
  - Add plates to order with quantities and notes
  - Add drinks to order with quantities and notes
  - Real-time order total calculation
  - Dynamic forms for adding items
- **Routes**: 
  - `/orders/create` (new order)
  - `/orders/:id/edit` (edit existing)

## Router Updates

Added the following routes to `/var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant/frontend/src/router/index.js`:

```javascript
{
  path: '/orders',
  name: 'OrdersList',
  component: () => import('../views/OrdersList.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresRestaurant: true }
},
{
  path: '/orders/create',
  name: 'OrderCreate',
  component: () => import('../views/OrderCreate.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresRestaurant: true }
},
{
  path: '/orders/:id',
  name: 'OrderDetail',
  component: () => import('../views/OrderDetail.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresRestaurant: true }
},
{
  path: '/orders/:id/edit',
  name: 'OrderEdit',
  component: () => import('../views/OrderCreate.vue'),
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresRestaurant: true }
}
```

## Component Updates

### BaseListView.vue
- Added support for custom filters slot
- Allows child components to add filtering UI above the items grid

### SidebarComponent.vue
- Updated Orders navigation link to use router-link instead of click handler
- Ensures proper active state highlighting for orders routes

## API Endpoints Used

The views integrate with the following backend API endpoints:

### Orders
- `GET /api/orders` - Get all orders (with filters)
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get single order
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `PATCH /api/orders/:id` - Update order
- `DELETE /api/orders/:id` - Delete order

### Order Items
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/plates` - Add plate to order
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/drinks` - Add drink to order
- `POST /api/orders/plates/:orderPlateId/products` - Add product to order plate

### Supporting Data
- `GET /api/tables` - Get tables for restaurant
- `GET /api/plates` - Get plates for restaurant  
- `GET /api/drinks` - Get drinks for restaurant

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Order Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete orders
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter orders by status, table, and date
3. **Order Status Workflow**: Progress orders through different states
4. **Detailed Order Items**: Add plates and drinks with quantities and notes
5. **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic total calculation
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
7. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing restaurant management system

## Design Patterns

- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Uses BaseListView for consistent list interfaces
- Follows established routing and component structure
- Implements proper error handling and loading states
- Uses Italian localization consistent with the rest of the app

## Technical Notes

- **Missing API Endpoints**: The backend doesn't currently support deleting individual order items (plates/drinks), so this functionality was removed from the OrderCreate view
- **Restaurant Context**: All operations are scoped to the currently selected restaurant
- **Authentication**: All routes require authentication and restaurant selection
- **State Management**: Uses localStorage for authentication tokens and restaurant selection

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   cd /var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd /var/home/rlira/Documenti/programming/rest_your_ant/frontend
   npm run serve
   ```

3. Navigate to the Orders section through the sidebar navigation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Delete Order Items**: Add backend endpoints to support deleting individual plates/drinks from orders
2. **Order Products Management**: Add UI for managing plate product modifications (add/remove ingredients)
3. **Order History**: Add order history and analytics views
4. **Print Integration**: Add order printing functionality for kitchen/receipts
5. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time order status updates
